To generate a good piece of music, we need model to understand what is good inside a music. To learn such sequence data, RNN is the most powerful architecture. With the help of Pytorch RNN module, we implemented RNN models with different sizes, types, and dropout values, as well as other factors like batch-size, optimizers, etc.. And finally, after training by Adagrad optimizer with batch-size being 50, a RNN containing one LSTM layer with 150 units, gave us the best validation loss, 1.617 and many beautiful musics.
